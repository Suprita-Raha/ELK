## Charts<br>

1. Which age group contributes the most revenue to the business product category wise?<br>

   **Age Group Sales Distribution by Product Category**

   **Description:** This bar chart displays sales values for Accessories and Clothing across two age groups: Adults (35-64) and Youth (<25). It helps identify the core 
   customer demographic and their product preferences, supporting targeted marketing strategies and refined efforts for youth-focused campaigns.

   ![Graph -1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cce62f8a-b604-42b6-b68b-4c221c7cda02)

   The graph shows that **Adults (35-54)** generate the highest revenue across all product categories, with **clothing** being the dominant contributor, followed by 
   **Accessories**. **Young Adults (25-34)** rank second in revenue, while **Youth (<25)** contribute the least. This indicates that marketing efforts should focus on 
   **Adults** and enhancing engagement with the **younger age group**.<br>

3. How has the revenue trended over time compared to profit?<br>

   **Revenue and Profit Trend Over Time**

   **Description:** This line chart illustrates trends in revenue and profit over a specific time period, highlighting fluctuations and divergences between the two metrics.
